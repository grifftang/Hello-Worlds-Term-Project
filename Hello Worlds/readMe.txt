—————————————————————————————————-——Hello Worlds Read Me——————————————————————————————————
Welcome to Hello Worlds, a gravity arcade game with some modern twists. Gravitate around suns by clicking opposite the direction you want to go; the goal is to swing yourself into the red portals. In addition, create your own level through the in-game instructions and find it in the level selection menu as the newest level! If you’re having trouble with a level, press ‘H’ to show the gravitational vector fields and slow the game down! Take your time and move the mouse very carefully. 

To run, execute ‘Hello Worlds.py’ in a folder with ‘HelloWorldsObjects.py,’ ‘levels.txt,’ and folders ‘Fonts,’ ‘Images,’ and ‘Sounds.’ You will also need to install the third-party library ‘pygame’ by routing your terminal to python and executing the command ‘pip3 install pygame.’
